EMT v1.31 (Release date: 2024-03-20)
====================================

BUG FIXES:

* Minor output bug fixed in response to a suggestion by Boris Mayer  
* Bug fixed concerning numerical precision in response to pull request #1 at https://github.com/cran/EMT/pull/1 by Boris Mayer.

CHANGES:
 
* Functions for Monte Carlo methods have been essentially modified in order to save memory and increase stability during repeated runs. 
* Improved graphics for the Exact Multinomial test: probabilities contributing to the p-value are marked red.
* Barplots for the Monte Carlo methods have been disabled because of limited usefulness.
