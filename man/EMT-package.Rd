\title{Exact Multinomial Test: Goodness-of-Fit Test for Discrete Multivariate Data}

\description{
  The package provides functions to carry out a Goodness-of-fit test for discrete multivariate data. 
  It is tested if a given observation is likely to have occurred under the assumption of an ab-initio model. 
  A p-value can be calculated using different distance measures between observed and expected frequencies. 
  A Monte Carlo method is provided to make the package capable of solving high-dimensional problems.  
  The main user functions are \code{multinomial.test} and \code{plotMultinom}.
